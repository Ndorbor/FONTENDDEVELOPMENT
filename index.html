   <p> On May 23, 2024, there was a major presentation by students of the Business College reading Computer Applications.
        The presentaion was held in the department of Research at the Lofa County University. The class was divided into two: Information and Communication groups.
        Students and instructors from different departments were invited by Mr. Morlu to grace the occation. At the end of the presentation, the invited guests were asked to give
        comments regarding thier observation and perception. All of them appreciated Mr. Morlu and the students but identified major lapses from the students during the presentation.
        Accourding to the guests, students were presenting outside the presentation slides and most of them encountered fobia during the presentaion.
